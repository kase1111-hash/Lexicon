## Why This License?

This is research infrastructure for the commons. Academics, hobbyists, indie developers, and small startups can use it freely. Large corporations who want to commercialize it can reach out for a separate commercial agreement.

The goal is to prevent a scenario where a well-funded company takes this work, builds a proprietary product on top, and offers nothing back to the research community.
